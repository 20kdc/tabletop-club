# OpenTabletop Assets

One of the really cool things about OpenTabletop is that you can create,
modify, and use your own (or someone else's) assets in the game using your
favourite image-editing/3d-modelling/text-editing software, all without having
to edit the game or use Godot!

## Asset Pack Structure

folder are split up into **packs**. Each pack has a set of assets within it
that are divided into different sub-folders. The game comes with the default
OpenTabletop asset pack included.
