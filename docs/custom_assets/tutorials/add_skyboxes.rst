Adding skyboxes
===============

To add your own skybox to the game, simply create a ``skyboxes`` folder inside
your asset pack, then place your skybox image into that folder, like this:

.. code-block::
   
   MyAssetPack
       └── skyboxes
           └── My Skybox.png

Note that the only format that the game will accept is an equirectangular image.

For more information, see :ref:`asset-type-skybox`.
