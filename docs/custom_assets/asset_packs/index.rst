Asset packs
***********

To make the management and sharing of custom assets easier, assets are put into
what are called **asset packs**, which are essentially just specially-made
folders. This chapter describes the specification for the custom assets, and
the asset packs that contain them.

For reference, you can have a look at the OpenTabletop asset pack, which comes
with the game by default.

For easy-to-follow tutorials on how to make assets and asset packs, see
:ref:`custom-asset-tutorials`.
