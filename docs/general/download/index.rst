There are two ways to download and play Tabletop Club:

* By downloading the official binary for your platform and running the
  executable. This is by far the simplest method, and it is all that most
  players need to do.

* By downloading the source code from the game's repository and compiling it
  from scratch. This requires a few extra steps compared to running a pre-built
  binary, but you'll need to do this if you plan on contributing to the game
  code, or you could try it for fun!
